R is very powerful but it lacks some of the functionalities found in Stata or SPSS to manage survey data. The `memisc` package provides these (variable labels, value labels, definable missing values and so on), but to efficiently work these functions need a graphical interface to allow the user to get an overview of the data. This package provides such a graphical interface, similar in fashion to SPSS's Variable View and data managing system. It uses the `memisc` package as its backend. Additionally, `Rz` has a powerful plot assistant interface based on `ggplot2`.
